## Overview

The **Cellular Automata Engine** is an interactive project designed to showcase three types of cellular automata. It allows users to explore, manipulate, and experience these automata through an engaging interface. The engine incorporates features like board resizing, dynamic ruleset generation, and particle physics simulations.
