Cellular Automata Engine 

This project is meant to demonstrate 3 types of cellular automata 
in a way that allows the user to play around and experience the 
automata. 


To run the program, go into main and press control b.

There are no libraries or modules that need to be installed. All classes
used are imported into the class object files. 

For commands and keybinds, the application will write out all you need.
