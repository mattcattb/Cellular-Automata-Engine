Cellular Automata Engine 

This project is meant to demonstrate 3 types of cellular automata 
in a way that allows the user to play around and experience the 
automata. 

To run the program, properly install cmu_112 graphics according to their website here:
https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~112/notes/notes-graphics.html
 
For commands and keybinds, the application will write out all you need to know.
